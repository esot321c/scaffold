# Scaffold

> An open-source TypeScript foundation for modern web applications.

Scaffold is a production-ready, authentication-first foundation for building modern web applications. It combines the power of NestJS on the backend with Tanstack Router and shadcn/ui on the frontend to provide a complete, type-safe development experience.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Monorepo Structure**: A monorepo approach was chosen to enable sharing TypeScript types between frontend and backend, ensuring complete type safety across the application boundary. This could be broken into separate repos, and the types package could be published as an npm package or hosted in a private package registry (like GitHub Packages, Azure Artifacts, or Nexus Repository) if needed. The monorepo approach simplifies development workflow and ensures types stay in sync during rapid development, while still allowing for future separation if organizational needs require it.
- **Separate Frontend/Backend**: Rather than using a serverless web app, this architecture provides the flexibility to run background jobs, notification systems, and cron tasks. It also supports multiple client applications (web, Android, iOS) sharing the same backend API.
- **NestJS for Backend**: Provides a structured, modular architecture with dependency injection, making the codebase maintainable and testable. The patterns established here could be implemented in other backend languages like C#/.NET, Rust, or Go if team expertise or performance requirements change in the future.
- **PostgreSQL with Prisma**: Offers type-safe database access with migrations, ensuring data integrity and developer productivity.
- **Redis for Caching**: The system includes Redis infrastructure for performance optimization, allowing efficient caching of external API responses, expensive database queries, or other frequently accessed data. This caching layer can significantly reduce latency and minimize costs when integrating with rate-limited or pay-per-call third-party services.
- **Session-Based Authentication**: We implemented a hybrid JWT+session approach for auth, providing the flexibility of JWTs while maintaining the security benefits of server-side sessions with explicit invalidation capability.
- **Comprehensive Security Logging**: Security events are systematically logged and available both to users (for their own activity) and administrators, improving transparency and aiding in security incident response.
- **CSRF Protection**: All non-GET endpoints are protected by CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks, with a cookie-based implementation. This is enforced through a global middleware that protects all routes except those explicitly excluded (such as OAuth callbacks), ensuring consistent security across the application.
- **Automated Token Rotation**: The system implements a scheduled token rotation mechanism that automatically refreshes sessions nearing expiration, enhancing security without disrupting user experience. This helps prevent session hijacking while maintaining seamless authentication.
- **Configurable Security Log Retention**: The system includes an automated log cleanup service that prunes older security logs according to configurable retention periods. This helps maintain system performance while preserving important security audit trails for an appropriate duration based on organizational requirements.
- **Device Management**: The system tracks and allows management of authenticated devices, enhancing security by giving users visibility and control over their active sessions.
- **Admin Module Separation**: Admin functionality is isolated in its own module with separate guards, providing clear separation of concerns.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local database)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/esot321c/scaffold
cd scaffold

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
cp packages/frontend/.env.example packages/frontend/.env
```

### Environment Configuration

1. **Generate secure passwords for Redis and Postgres**:

```bash
# Generate Redis password
openssl rand -hex 16

# Generate Postgres password
openssl rand -hex 16

# Generate JWT Secret
openssl rand -hex 32
```

2. **Update backend .env file** with your generated values and OAuth credentials

3. **Set up Google OAuth** (required):
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback`
   - Copy Client ID and Secret to your backend .env file

### Start Development Environment

```bash
# Start Postgres and Redis
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
pnpm --filter backend db:migrate

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- API Documentation: http://localhost:3001/api

## PII Data Encryption

The application implements field-level encryption for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the database. This provides an additional security layer beyond standard database encryption at rest.

### Approach

We use a transparent encryption middleware in Prisma that automatically handles encryption, decryption, and lookups:

- **Field-level encryption**: User PII fields (email, name, phone, address) are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Searchable encryption**: Email, name, and phone lookups work through indexed hash fields
- **Redis-backed caching**: Hash values are cached in Redis for performance optimization
- **Zero-code change**: Application code continues to work with the original fields

### Implementation Details

The system uses a dual-key approach:

- An encryption key for AES-256-GCM encryption of the actual values
- A separate hash key for generating searchable, consistent hash values

### Configuration

Required environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-encryption-key
DATABASE_HASH_KEY=your-secure-hash-key
REDIS_URL=redis://username:password@your-redis-host:6379
```

Generate secure keys with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Edge Cases & Considerations

1. **Null/Empty Values**: The system handles null and empty values gracefully by returning null rather than attempting to encrypt or hash them.

2. **Migration of Existing Data**: When implementing this on an existing database, a migration script must run to encrypt all existing PII data.

3. **Search Limitations**:

   - Only exact matches work through the hash system
   - Case-insensitive searches are supported (values are normalized before hashing)
   - Partial searches (LIKE '%value%') are not supported on encrypted fields

4. **Performance Considerations**:

   - Redis caching significantly improves performance for repeated lookups
   - Complex queries with multiple OR conditions have some performance overhead
   - Initial encryption/migration may be resource-intensive

5. **Security Trade-offs**:
   - Hash lookups provide searchability but reduce some entropy
   - Using separate hash and encryption keys mitigates some risks
   - Hashed values are not encrypted but don't directly expose PII

### Usage Notes

The encryption/decryption process is transparent to application code; however, developers should be aware of:

1. The need to migrate data when implementing on existing databases
2. Inability to do partial or fuzzy searches on encrypted fields
3. The need to maintain secure encryption and hash keys
4. The overhead of encryption/decryption operations

For scenarios where more advanced search functionality is required, consider alternatives like:

- Using tokenization instead of encryption for specific fields
- Implementing secure search indexes
- Using a dedicated encrypted search solution
